## Course Outline

The course will cover the following topics:^[Any feedback on slides and the content will be greatly appreciated as I iterate over the material]

-   Predictive Inference with Linear Regression
-   Basics in Causal Inference (Randomized Experiments, ...)
-   Machine Learning Methods (Lasso, Random Forests, ...)
-   Statistical Inference in High-dimensional Linear Regression
-   Causal Inference via Conditional Exogeneity
-   Structural Equations and DAGs
-   Statistical Inference in Modern Nonlinear Regression
-   Double Machine Learning
-   Optional Advanced Topics (high-dimensional IV models, Difference-in-Differences with Machine Learning, Panel data, Sensitivity Analysis, ...)


<!-- ## Description -->

<!-- The course will cover basic principles of **causal inference** and **machine learning** and how the two can be combined in practice to deliver estimates for causal parameters in real world datasets.  -->
<!-- The lectures will cover fundamentals, e.g. econometric models and DAGs and introduce tools for statistical inference based on machine learning (lasso, random forest, ...) to **infer** causal parameters and **quantify uncertainty**. We apply machine learning methods to handle **high-dimensional data**. The tutorials will involve real world and simulated data analysis in **R** based on these methodologies. -->
<!-- Lectures and tutorials will be on-site and will not be recorded.  -->

## Causal machine learning

<!-- ## Causal machine learning combines two literatures -->


<!-- **Machine Learning**: -->

<!-- Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make good predictions or decisions. Often, these methods are applied without further consideration even if the goal is to uncover some causal answers: -->

<!-- -   Resource allocation -->
<!-- -   Predict the quality of a new promotion -->
<!-- -   Forecast the turnover for a new product -->


<!-- **Causality**: -->

<!-- Influence by which one event contributes to the production of another event where the cause is partly responsible for the effect. -->



<!-- $\Rightarrow$ **Causal Machine Learning:** Use the predictive power of modern machine learning algorithms to provide precise estimates for causal effects/parameters!  -->

## What to expect

-   Recap/learn the **Causal Inference** and **Machine Learning** basics
-   Learn econometric models for high-dimensional data
-   Learn recent Causal ML methods (e.g. **Double Machine Learning**) for estimation of (average) treatment effects
-   Get to know recent software (e.g. DoubleML package in R) to apply Causal ML algorithm in practice
-   Guest lecture with one of the developers of the DoubleML package
